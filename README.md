If you're interested in contributing to the wiki and need write permissions, please make a request on the [forum](http://forum.lwjgl.org).

If you already have permissions, please do not use Github's interface for creating new pages. Clone the [wiki repository](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-wiki.wiki.git) locally and push changes manually. Make sure new files adhere to the existing layout and naming scheme and that sidebars are updated accordingly.

When working on a page, use of a WYSIWYG markdown editor is highly recommended (e.g. https://stackedit.io/). If the page contains images, you can use an image sharing service (http://tinypic.com/, http://imgur.com/, etc). Interesting content that has been finalized may also be hosted on the LWJGL CDN (make a request on the forum).
